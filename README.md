# LLM for Music Production — DSP Foundation

Research project goal: **natural-language instruction + audio information → LLM → structured EQ/Reverb parameters.**

This stage implements only the DSP foundation the rest of the pipeline will build on:
audio I/O, synthetic test signal generation, FFT-based spectral analysis, 1D
convolution/filtering, parametric EQ (biquad IIR filters), and a batch audio
preprocessing pipeline. No LLM, reverb, or feature-extraction logic is included yet.

## Structure

```
src/llm_music/
    audio_io.py     # load_audio / save_audio (torchaudio-backed)
    signals.py      # generate_sine / generate_multitone
    spectrum.py     # compute_fft / magnitude_to_db
    convolution.py  # convolve (full 1D linear convolution) / moving_average_kernel /
                    # frequency_response (a filter's own magnitude response)
    eq.py           # biquad filter design (lowpass, highpass, peaking, low_shelf,
                    # high_shelf) and apply_biquad (IIR filtering via torchaudio.lfilter)
    preprocess.py   # resample / to_mono / normalize_peak / normalize_rms / segment,
                    # and preprocess_batch tying them into one pipeline
scripts/
    demo_audio.py # generates a 440 Hz + 1000 Hz tone (saves WAV + plots, prints FFT
                  # peaks); a 440 Hz + 4000 Hz tone filtered with a moving-average
                  # kernel to compare original vs. filtered spectra and the kernel's own
                  # frequency response; each parametric EQ filter type's response; and a
                  # batch preprocessing run over two files with different sample rates
                  # and loudness
tests/
    test_dsp.py         # sine length, FFT peak accuracy, save/load consistency
    test_convolution.py # convolution output length, impulse response, kernel normalization
    test_eq.py          # each biquad filter type's frequency response behaves as designed
    test_preprocess.py  # resample/mono/normalize/segment correctness, batch pipeline shape
data/
    input/        # place source audio here (demo also writes its preprocessing inputs here)
    output/       # generated audio and plots land here
```

## Setup

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```powershell
python scripts/demo_audio.py
```

Outputs `test_signal.wav`, `waveform.png`, `spectrum.png`, `filter_comparison.png`,
`filter_frequency_response.png`, and `eq_frequency_responses.png` under `data/output/`,
and prints the strongest FFT frequency bins to the console.

## Tests

```powershell
pytest tests/
```

## Conventions

- Waveform tensors: `torch.Tensor` of shape `(samples,)` or `(channels, samples)`;
  functions handle both.
- All paths use `pathlib.Path` for Windows compatibility.
- `src/` layout — scripts and tests add `src/` to `sys.path` at runtime rather than
  requiring an editable install.
